# hello-world
I am just a beginner, who is interested in the basics, and this is my first foray.
The only "coding" experience I have had to date is being shown how to "ping" another computer. (About 16 years ago, now that I think about it.) I don't even remember how to do it, but I feel like coding is something everyone should have a basic knowledge of, so here goes! 
I have an almost 1 1/2 year old son, and I want to be able to show the world to him in every way my husband and I can. I run on coffee, baby snuggles, and sheer force of will. "Though she be but little, she is fierce!" 
I was an English major with eclectic tastes, and I suppose coding is, to my mind, another form of literacy.
